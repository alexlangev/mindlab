## variables

defining variables in a bash shell will last until you close the terminal.

String interpolation uses the $ prefix

```bash
name="alex"
echo $name
```


## grep

Search strings across one or many files.

```bash
# search across a single file

```
## find

```bash
# search for an exact file name in a directory
find some_directory -name hello.txt

# search pattern match using wildcards
find some_directory -name "*.txt"
```
